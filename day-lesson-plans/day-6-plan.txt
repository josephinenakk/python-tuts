    How to define variables in Python ?


GitHub : 

    Solved an issue - 
            Learned the process to push the changes when we have a new branch created 
            locally before we create it in the GitHub(Remote) repository and trying 
            to push the changes to it.


    git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>
